HDRP Error:
----------

1. Compiling issue when importing the HDRP.

Uninstall the HDRP and Core RP & Shader Graph and reinstall the HDRP from resource manager 
and the other will be automatically installed. if not you can install them to the latest version, which must be same version of the hdrp.

For Example if the installed version of HDRP is 5.13.0 then the CORE RP & Shader Graph should be also version 5.13.0.

Note: if you have LWRP unstall it as both the HDRP and LWRP are not compatible with each other and will create compiling issue. 
	  Always use any one & check the Core RP 7 & Shader graph vesion mathing their version.
